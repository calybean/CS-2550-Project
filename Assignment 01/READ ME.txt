I'm going to try this out and you can decide if it works for you or not.

Here is the url where I've uploaded my website:
http://youravgjoe.com/Assignment%2001/index.html

And here is the github repository where all of my code is:
https://github.com/youravgjoe/CS-2550-Project

Again, let me know if this works, or if you would rather I just upload the files directly to canvas.
