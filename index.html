    This is a two player game. Choose your colors and enter your names on the next page.
    This game is played by clicking first on the checker that you wish to move, and then
    clicking on the space you wish to move it to. Only single jumps are allowed. Your
    pieces may only move forward until they have reached the other side of the board,
    where they become kings and can then move forward or backward.
